# Day 17 – Cloud Logging and Monitoring

## Objective
To understand why logging and monitoring are critical in cloud environments and how visibility enables detection, investigation, and response to security incidents.

---

## Why Logging Matters in the Cloud
In cloud environments:
- Infrastructure is abstracted
- Systems change rapidly
- Direct system access is limited

> Logs become the primary source of truth.

Without logs, cloud security incidents are invisible.

---

## What Cloud Logging Means
Cloud logging involves:
- Recording identity activity
- Tracking API calls
- Monitoring network connections
- Capturing service-level events
- Storing logs centrally

Logs show **who did what, when, and from where**.

---

## Key Types of Cloud Logs
Important cloud log categories include:
- **Identity and Access Logs** (logins, role usage)
- **API Activity Logs** (resource creation, deletion)
- **Network Logs** (traffic flows, connections)
- **Service Logs** (storage, compute, databases)
- **Security Alerts and Findings**

Each log type provides different visibility.

---

## Monitoring vs Logging
**Logging:**
- Records events
- Used for investigation
- Historical data

**Monitoring:**
- Watches logs and metrics in real time
- Triggers alerts
- Enables rapid response

> Logging is passive. Monitoring is active.

---

## Common Visibility Gaps
Cloud visibility fails when:
- Logging is disabled by default
- Logs are scattered across services
- Retention periods are too short
- No alerts are configured
- Logs are never reviewed

> Unmonitored logs are almost as bad as no logs.

---

## Detection Use Cases
Cloud monitoring helps detect:
- Suspicious login locations
- Excessive API calls
- Unexpected resource creation
- Data access spikes
- Permission escalation attempts

Detection focuses on **behavior**, not signatures.

---

## Security Analyst Perspective
Analysts use cloud logs to:
- Investigate alerts
- Build attack timelines
- Trace identity misuse
- Validate incidents
- Support threat hunting

Logs turn assumptions into evidence.

---

## Defense Perspective
Effective cloud logging requires:
- Enabling logs across all services
- Centralizing log storage
- Setting meaningful alerts
- Retaining logs long enough for investigations
- Regular review and tuning

> Visibility must be designed, not assumed.

---

## Real-World Relevance
Many cloud breaches went undetected because:
- Logging was disabled
- Alerts were never configured
- Logs were deleted too quickly

Attackers rely on **blind spots**, not exploits.

---

## Key Learning of Day 17
- Cloud security depends on visibility  
- Logs provide evidence, monitoring provides speed  
- Without logging and monitoring, cloud defense is impossible
