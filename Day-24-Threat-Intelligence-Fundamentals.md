# Day 24 – Threat Intelligence Fundamentals

## Objective
To understand what threat intelligence is, how it is used in cybersecurity operations, and why context-driven intelligence improves detection, response, and decision-making.

---

## What Threat Intelligence Means
Threat intelligence is **analyzed information about threats** that helps organizations:
- Understand attacker behavior
- Identify risks
- Make informed security decisions

> Intelligence is not raw data.  
It is **data with context and meaning**.

---

## Types of Threat Intelligence
Threat intelligence is commonly categorized into four types:

### Strategic Intelligence
- High-level trends
- Threat landscape overview
- Business and risk impact
- Used by leadership and decision-makers

---

### Tactical Intelligence
- Tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)
- How attackers operate
- Mapped to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK
- Used by security teams

---

### Operational Intelligence
- Information about active campaigns
- Targeted industries or regions
- Ongoing attack methods
- Used during investigations and response

---

### Technical Intelligence
- Indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- IP addresses, domains, hashes
- Used in detection tools

> Technical intelligence is short-lived.  
Behavioral intelligence lasts longer.

---

## Sources of Threat Intelligence
Common sources include:
- Open-source intelligence (OSINT)
- Commercial threat feeds
- Government advisories
- Information sharing communities
- Internal incident data

Quality matters more than quantity.

---

## How Threat Intelligence Is Used
Threat intelligence supports:
- Detection rule creation
- Threat hunting hypotheses
- Incident response prioritization
- Risk assessments
- Security strategy planning

> Intelligence guides **where to look and what to expect**.

---

## Threat Intelligence vs Alerts
**Alerts:**
- Indicate something happened
- Reactive

**Threat Intelligence:**
- Explains why it matters
- Proactive

Intelligence adds **context** to alerts.

---

## Challenges with Threat Intelligence
Common challenges include:
- Too many low-quality feeds
- Outdated indicators
- Lack of context
- Poor integration with tools
- No clear use case

Unused intelligence provides no value.

---

## Defense Perspective
Effective threat intelligence requires:
- Clear objectives
- Integration with SIEM, EDR, and SOC workflows
- Analyst validation
- Continuous feedback and improvement

> Intelligence must drive action.

---

## Real-World Relevance
Threat intelligence helps organizations:
- Anticipate attacker behavior
- Detect attacks earlier
- Respond faster and smarter
- Reduce uncertainty during incidents

Attackers reuse techniques.  
Defenders who study them gain advantage.

## Key Learning of Day 24
- Threat intelligence turns data into understanding  
- Context is more valuable than indicators  
- Intelligence strengthens detection, hunting, and response
