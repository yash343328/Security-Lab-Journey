# Day 15 – Cloud Logging and Monitoring

## Objective

# 

To understand the role of logging and monitoring in cloud environments and how visibility helps detect misconfigurations and attacks.

* * *

## Why Logging Is Critical in the Cloud

# 

Cloud environments are dynamic and distributed.

Without logging:

-   Actions cannot be traced
    
-   Misconfigurations go unnoticed
    
-   Attacks remain hidden
    
-   Compliance becomes difficult
    

Logging is the foundation of cloud security visibility.

* * *

## Types of Cloud Logs

# 

Common cloud logs include:

-   Identity and access logs
    
-   API call logs
    
-   Network traffic logs
    
-   Storage access logs
    
-   Application and service logs
    

Each log type provides a different security perspective.

* * *

## Cloud Monitoring Challenges

# 

Monitoring cloud environments is challenging because:

-   Resources scale automatically
    
-   Services change frequently
    
-   Logs are spread across regions
    
-   Large data volumes are generated
    

Security teams must handle constant change.

* * *

## Misconfiguration Detection

# 

Logging helps detect:

-   Unauthorized API calls
    
-   Unexpected resource creation
    
-   Public access to services
    
-   Excessive permission usage
    
-   Unusual network activity
    

Many cloud incidents are first visible in logs.

* * *

## Alerting and Baselines

# 

Effective monitoring requires:

-   Defining normal behavior
    
-   Creating meaningful alerts
    
-   Reducing false positives
    
-   Prioritizing high-risk events
    

Alerts should indicate real risk, not noise.

* * *

## Integration with SIEM

# 

Cloud logs are most useful when:

-   Centralized in a SIEM
    
-   Correlated with endpoint and network logs
    
-   Used for threat hunting
    

Integration improves detection accuracy.

* * *

## Defense Perspective

# 

To improve cloud monitoring:

-   Enable logging by default
    
-   Secure log storage
    
-   Monitor identity and API activity
    
-   Regularly review alerts
    
-   Automate basic detection
    

Visibility enables faster response.

* * *

## Real-World Relevance

# 

Many cloud breaches were detected because:

-   Unusual API usage was noticed
    
-   Logs showed unauthorized access
    
-   Monitoring alerts triggered investigations
    

Without monitoring, incidents remain invisible.

* * *

## Key Learning of Day 15

# 

Cloud security depends on visibility.

Logging records activity.  
Monitoring turns logs into awareness.  
Together, they enable detection and response in cloud environments.
