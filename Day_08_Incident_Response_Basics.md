# Day 8 – Incident Response Basics

## Objective
To understand what incident response is, why it is important, and how organizations react when a security incident occurs.

---

## What Is a Security Incident
A security incident is any event that:
- Compromises confidentiality
- Affects system integrity
- Disrupts availability
- Violates security policies

> Not every alert is an incident, but every incident starts with an alert.

---

## Why Incident Response Is Critical
Attacks are not a question of **if**, but **when**.

Incident response focuses on:
- Limiting damage
- Stopping attacker activity
- Preserving evidence
- Restoring systems safely

> Without a response plan, small incidents become major breaches.

---

## Basic Incident Response Phases
A simple incident response process includes:
1. Preparation
2. Detection and identification
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons learned

> Each phase is equally important.

---

## Detection and Identification
In this phase:
- Alerts are analyzed
- Logs are reviewed
- Suspicious behavior is confirmed
- Scope of the incident is identified

> Incorrect identification can cause unnecessary downtime or missed attacks.

---

## Containment and Eradication

### Containment (Stopping the Spread)
- Isolating affected systems
- Disabling compromised accounts
- Blocking malicious traffic

### Eradication (Removing the Root Cause)
- Removing malware
- Fixing vulnerabilities
- Resetting credentials

> Quick containment reduces impact.

---

## Recovery and Restoration
Recovery includes:
- Restoring systems from clean backups
- Verifying system integrity
- Monitoring for recurring activity
- Bringing services back online safely

> Recovery must be careful, not rushed.

---

## Post-Incident Learning
After recovery:
- Analyze what went wrong
- Improve detection and controls
- Update response procedures
- Train teams

> Every incident is a learning opportunity.

---

## Real-World Relevance
Many organizations suffer repeated attacks because:
- Lessons are not documented
- Root causes are not fixed
- Monitoring is not improved

> Incident response maturity improves over time.

---

## Key Learning of Day 8
- Incident response is not just a technical task
- It is a structured process combining analysis, decision-making, and communication
- Preparedness reduces panic and damage during real attacks
