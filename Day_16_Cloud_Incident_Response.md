# Day 16 – Cloud Incident Response

## Objective
To understand how incident response works in cloud environments and how it differs from traditional on-premise incident response.

---

## Why Cloud Incident Response Is Different
Cloud environments:
- Are highly dynamic  
- Scale automatically  
- Rely heavily on APIs  
- Use shared infrastructure  

> Traditional response methods do not fully apply in the cloud.

---

## What a Cloud Security Incident Is
A cloud incident includes:
- Unauthorized access to cloud resources  
- Misconfigured storage exposure  
- Compromised cloud identities  
- Suspicious API activity  
- Data exfiltration from cloud services  

> Identity misuse is the most common cloud incident.

---

## Detection in Cloud Environments
Cloud incident detection relies on:
- Identity and access logs  
- API activity monitoring  
- Network traffic logs  
- Service-level alerts  

> Detection focuses on **actions**, not devices.

---

## Containment Strategies
In cloud environments, containment includes:
- Revoking or rotating credentials  
- Restricting identity permissions  
- Isolating affected resources  
- Blocking malicious IPs or regions  

> Quick containment prevents widespread impact.

---

## Eradication and Cleanup
Eradication focuses on:
- Removing malicious resources  
- Fixing misconfigurations  
- Patching vulnerable services  
- Removing unauthorized access paths  

> Cloud cleanup often involves **automation**.

---

## Recovery and Validation
Recovery includes:
- Restoring clean configurations  
- Verifying identity permissions  
- Monitoring for recurring activity  
- Reviewing resource integrity  

> Recovery must ensure attackers **cannot return**.

---

## Post-Incident Improvements
After a cloud incident:
- Review identity policies  
- Improve logging and alerts  
- Automate configuration checks  
- Update incident response playbooks  

> Cloud security improves with each incident.

---

## Real-World Relevance
Many cloud breaches escalated because:
- Credential rotation was delayed  
- Permissions were too broad  
- Incidents were misunderstood  

> In the cloud, **response speed is critical**.

---

## Key Learning of Day 16
- Cloud incident response is **identity-focused and API-driven**  
- Fast containment, strong visibility, and configuration discipline  
  are essential to minimize damage in cloud environments
