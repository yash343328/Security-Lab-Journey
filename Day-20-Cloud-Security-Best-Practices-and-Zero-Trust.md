# Day 20 – Cloud Security Best Practices and Zero Trust

## Objective
To understand core cloud security best practices and how Zero Trust principles apply to modern cloud environments.

---

## What Zero Trust Means in the Cloud
Zero Trust is a security model based on one rule:

> **Never trust. Always verify.**

In cloud environments:
- No network location is inherently trusted
- Every request is authenticated
- Every action is authorized
- Continuous verification is required

Trust is replaced with **validation**.

---

## Why Zero Trust Fits the Cloud
Zero Trust aligns with cloud because:
- Cloud access is identity-driven
- Resources are API-controlled
- Perimeters are fluid or nonexistent
- Remote access is normal

> Identity becomes the new security boundary.

---

## Core Cloud Security Best Practices
Strong cloud security starts with fundamentals:

### Identity and Access Management
- Enforce least privilege
- Use role-based access
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Rotate and protect credentials
- Review permissions regularly

---

### Network Security
- Restrict inbound and outbound traffic
- Avoid public exposure by default
- Use segmentation between services
- Monitor traffic flows

---

### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Restrict access to sensitive data
- Monitor data access patterns
- Protect backups and snapshots

---

### Logging and Monitoring
- Enable logs across all cloud services
- Centralize log storage
- Set meaningful alerts
- Retain logs long enough for investigations

Visibility is mandatory.

---

### Secure Configuration
- Use secure-by-default templates
- Continuously scan for misconfigurations
- Automate compliance checks
- Treat misconfiguration as a vulnerability

---

## Applying Zero Trust in Practice
Zero Trust in the cloud means:
- Verifying every API request
- Limiting blast radius with least privilege
- Monitoring identity behavior continuously
- Assuming breach and detecting misuse

Security is continuous, not one-time.

---

## Operational Discipline
Cloud security requires:
- Clear ownership of resources
- Change management for configurations
- Incident response readiness
- Regular security reviews

> Tools do not replace process.

---

## Real-World Relevance
Cloud breaches decrease when:
- Identity is tightly controlled
- Permissions are minimal
- Logs are monitored
- Misconfigurations are fixed quickly

Most incidents are preventable.

---

## Key Learning of Day 20
- Cloud security is built on **identity, visibility, and configuration**  
- Zero Trust is a mindset, not a product  
- Consistent best practices prevent the majority of cloud attacks
