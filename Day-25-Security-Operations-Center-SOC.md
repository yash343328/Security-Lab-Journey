# Day 25 – Security Operations Center (SOC)

## Objective
To understand what a Security Operations Center is, how it functions, and why it is central to detecting, investigating, and responding to cybersecurity threats.

---

## What a SOC Is
A **Security Operations Center (SOC)** is a centralized function responsible for:
- Monitoring security events
- Detecting threats
- Investigating suspicious activity
- Responding to incidents
- Improving security posture over time

> A SOC is the nerve center of an organization’s cybersecurity operations.

---

## Why a SOC Is Needed
Modern environments generate:
- Massive volumes of logs
- Continuous alerts
- Complex attack patterns

A SOC helps:
- Centralize visibility
- Coordinate response
- Reduce attacker dwell time
- Ensure incidents are handled consistently

Without a SOC, attacks go unnoticed or unmanaged.

---

## Core SOC Functions
A SOC typically performs:
- Continuous monitoring (24/7 or business hours)
- Alert triage and validation
- Incident investigation
- Incident response coordination
- Threat hunting
- Reporting and improvement

SOC work is continuous, not event-based.

---

## SOC Data Sources
SOC teams rely on data from:
- SIEM platforms
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
- Network security tools
- Cloud logs and alerts
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Application and identity logs

Visibility defines SOC effectiveness.

---

## SOC Analyst Roles
Common SOC roles include:

### Tier 1 – Monitoring & Triage
- Review alerts
- Filter false positives
- Escalate confirmed issues

### Tier 2 – Investigation & Response
- Perform deep analysis
- Investigate incidents
- Contain and remediate threats

### Tier 3 – Advanced Analysis
- Threat hunting
- Malware analysis
- Detection engineering
- Tool and process improvement

Each tier builds on the previous one.

---

## SOC Workflows
A typical SOC workflow:
1. Alert is generated
2. Analyst validates the alert
3. Incident is investigated
4. Containment actions are taken
5. Incident is resolved
6. Lessons learned are documented

> Process is as important as technology.

---

## Challenges in a SOC
Common SOC challenges include:
- Alert fatigue
- High false-positive rates
- Tool overload
- Skill gaps
- Burnout

Effective SOCs focus on quality, not volume.

---

## SOC Metrics and Success
SOC performance is measured by:
- Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)
- Detection accuracy
- Incident impact reduction

Metrics guide improvement, not punishment.

---

## Real-World Relevance
Organizations with mature SOCs:
- Detect attacks earlier
- Respond faster
- Limit damage
- Learn from incidents

Attackers rely on slow or disorganized response.

---

## Key Learning of Day 25
- A SOC is the operational backbone of cybersecurity  
- Visibility, process, and people matter more than tools  
- A well-run SOC reduces risk through continuous detection and response
